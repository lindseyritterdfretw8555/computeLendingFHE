# ComputeLendingFHE: Empowering Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Lending of Computational Resources

ComputeLendingFHE is a revolutionary DeFi protocol designed for FHE-encrypted, peer-to-peer lending of computational resources. At its core, this platform leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, enabling users to securely lend and borrow computational power without sacrificing privacy or trust.

## Addressing the Challenge of Underutilized Computing Power

In today's tech landscape, vast amounts of computational resources, such as GPUs, remain idle while the demand for high-performance computing grows exponentially, particularly in fields like AI training and scientific simulations. This gap presents significant challenges: users with excess capacity struggle to monetize their resources, while those requiring computational power face the hurdles of trust and privacy in a centralized marketplace.

## How FHE Provides a Solution

ComputeLendingFHE harnesses the power of **Zama's open-source libraries** — specifically **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs** — to create a secure and private lending environment. By utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption, this protocol allows users to lend their computational resources in a way that keeps sensitive data protected throughout the entire transaction. Borrowers can perform computations over encrypted data and receive results without ever exposing the raw information or relying on a trust-based system.

## Core Functionalities

- **FHE-Encrypted Resource Proving**: Users can prove the availability of their compute resources encrypted with FHE to ensure confidentiality.
- **Decentralized Lending Market**: A global, trustless, privacy-focused decentralized market for computational resources.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Easily manage lending and borrowing activities through an intuitive interface featuring real-time analytics.
- **Flexible Interest Rates**: Lenders can set competitive interest rates for their resources, fostering an efficient marketplace.
- **Privacy Compliance**: All transactions comply with privacy standards, ensuring data protection for both lenders and borrowers.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Utilizing Zama's revolutionary libraries for confidential computing.
- **Solidity**: Smart contracts development for secure asset lending.
- **Node.js**: Building and running the backend services.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: For testing and deploying smart contracts.

## Project Directory Structure

Here’s a brief overview of the file structure of the ComputeLendingFHE project:

```

## Getting Started: Installation

To set up the ComputeLendingFHE project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **Hardhat** or **Foundry** (for development)

Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Navigate to the root of your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to fetch all key dependencies, including the necessary Zama FHE libraries.
3. Set up your environment variables as required.

## Building and Running the Project

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, follow these commands to build and run ComputeLendingFHE:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
   
2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

4. **Start the local development environment**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

This will launch a local Ethereum network for testing and allows you to interact with your contracts in a secure environment.

## Code Example: Lending Computation

Here's a basic example of how users can lend their computational resources securely by providing an FHE-encrypted proof:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./computeLendingFHE.sol";

contract ComputeLendingFHE {

    struct Resource {
        address lender;
        bytes encryptedProof;
        uint interestRate;
        bool isAvailable;
    }

    mapping(uint => Resource) public resources;

    function lendResource(uint resourceId, bytes memory _encryptedProof, uint _interestRate) public {
        resources[resourceId] = Resource({
            lender: msg.sender,
            encryptedProof: _encryptedProof,
            interestRate: _interestRate,
            isAvailable: true
        });
    }
}
```

This function allows users to lend their computational resources by submitting an encrypted proof, thus ensuring security and privacy.
